# Peter Greer Website Redesign

During my 2017 summer internship at HOPE International, I was tasked with redesigning the CEO's personal blog website to a more modernistic user friendly design.

This project primarily utilized the WordPress platform. One of the big changes of the website was to add e-commerce functionality to the web page. I decided to use the Shopify API as it was best suited with the resources we had. One of the big challenges I had was to integrate the API smoothly and functionally to the website.
